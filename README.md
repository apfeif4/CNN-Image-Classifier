# ðŸ§  CNN Image Processing on MNIST Dataset

This project implements a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** for handwritten digit recognition using the **MNIST dataset**. The goal is to build a deep learning model that accurately classifies digits from 0 to 9 based on grayscale image inputs.

## âœ… Project Status
**Completed**

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective

To apply CNN-based image processing techniques to the MNIST dataset in order to:

- Preprocess and normalize image data  
- Train a CNN to classify handwritten digits  
- Evaluate and visualize model performance  
- Make predictions on unseen data

---

## ðŸ§ª Methods Used

- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)  
- Accuracy Score & Confusion Matrix

---

## ðŸ’» Technologies & Libraries

- Python 3.x  
- TensorFlow / Keras  
- NumPy / Pandas  
- Matplotlib  
- Scikit-learn

---

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies
3. Run the Python script
4. Predict a new image


> *Note: Input images for prediction must be 28x28 pixels and grayscale.*
